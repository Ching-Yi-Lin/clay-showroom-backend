# Contributing

## How to contribute for the first time
1. Clone the app: 
```
git clone https://github.com/Ching-Yi-Lin/clay-showroom-backend.git
```
2. Create a dev branch: 
```
git checkout -b dev
```
"-b" means a new branch

3. Create a feature branch off the dev branch:

git checkout -b feat/add-edit-product
```
"feat" means this is a feature, and this feature will let the admins add and edit products
